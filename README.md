Uncertainty-driven lithological mapping: from data uncertainty to model uncertainty (UQDL v1.0)

Overview

Traditional lithological mapping with remote sensing data and deep learning models often ignores the sources of uncertainty arising from:

Data uncertainty — due to noise, limited observation, sampling issues, and measurement errors.

Model uncertainty — due to stochasticity in model parameters, architectures, or optimization.

UQDL v1.0 investigates uncertainty quantification in lithological mapping using remote sensing data and a Bayesian U-Net model:

(1) Data uncertainty quantification via stochastic simulation of probabilistic labels and noisy input images.

(2) Model uncertainty quantification via a Bayesian U-Net fully convolutional neural network (U-Net FCN) incorporating Monte Carlo Dropout.

(3) Visualizing uncertainties using SHAP technology to enhance model explainability.
